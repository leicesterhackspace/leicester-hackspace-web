The Hackspace is essentially a shared workshop run by the members for the members.

Imagine you had five friends with sets of tools, you all decided to get together and rent a double garage where you
would each work on your own projects in a shared space. You share the cost of rent and utilities. It’s not a service so
none of you are obliged to use the space or to help each other, but it’s there when you want to use it. As you are
friends you might also choose to help each other every now and again or to teach each other how to do something.

The Hackspace is just like that but instead of five members as of 2024 we currently have over 150 members.

## What's the space like?  {.header}

During Lockdown one of our members has created a short video tour of the Hackspace which can be viewed on our YouTube
channel. It's a little out of date, but it still pretty well shows off what we're about.

## How can the space used? {.header}

All members of The Hackspace have access to the space 24/7, 365 days a year. Initially new members
are advised to come in the evenings when others members are there until they really know their way around the space, 
as well as how to safely open up, and lock up the space.

All our tools and equipment are available to every member. Members, however, use the equipment strictly at their own 
risk and are self certifying as to their ability to use it safely. If help is required, then we have plenty of other 
members who will have experience in using any piece of equipment who would be happy to show you how, but that person 
**IS NOT** a formal technician or a teacher.

Members generally work on their own projects, but it's a great place to socialise, meet like-minded people to acquire
skills from, or pass skills on to.

## Who's currently in charge? {.header}
Leicester Hackspace is run by The Directors, who are unpaid, elected officials who are registered as directors of the
Leicester Hackspace Ltd company. It is the directors responsibility to handle the company side of the hackspace, 
including: Handling how money is spent, paying for the space, reporting to Companies House, setting rules, etc. etc...

We run quarterly and annual general meetings that all members are welcome to in order to update our members on the 
status of The Hackspace, as well as to transparently make large decisions with membership input.

## Our History {.header}

Since our opening in 2014, Leicester Hackspace has had 3 locations. Each move has given us more space to accommodate an
increase in Membership and space for more equipment.

Our first premises, shown above, was at the Makers Yard on Rutland St.

We then moved to the De Montfort University Innovation Centre.

Finally, in December 2017 we moved to premises on the Faircharm Trading Estate, where we remain today. This gave us 
space for heavy duty woodworking equipment and the prospects of a Laser Cutter.
