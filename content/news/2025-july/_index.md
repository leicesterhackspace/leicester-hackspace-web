We've had a massive tidy up!

For a little while now, our 3d printing room (The one in the middle) has been a total mess. Every usable surface was
covered in odd bits and bobs, rubish, and cool hackable components that were impossible to get to:

With little free table space, this room had become quite difficult to use or to find anything (and remained so for 2+
years).

But, with a full day's worth of effort, we have managed to tidy most of the room and bring **all** the desk space back!

*Only most of the room though.*

We have big plans for the other side though once we've finished sorting the CNC Milling Machines, so hopefully it will
be cleared as well soon!

Regardless, we're very happy to have all this table space back for members to use, especially since we managed it
with room to walk all the way around both tables!

At the same time as this, we installed an isolator switch on our power switchboard. Previously you could only turn off
the power to the hackspace via the business downstairs, so this is a huge step to allowing us to work on our electrics 
whenever we need!

Thank you to everyone who helped out!
