We finished 2025 of with a couple of events. Our regular Christmas Craft event  attended by members and some non-members.

Then on a Thursday Night Tracey organised a wreath making session for members. This was another popular event and will hopefully be repeated next year.

Looking forward to 2026 we are running a few workshops for members, the use of hand tools in woodworking, Arduino Programming and an Introduction to micro python on a Pico.

The main event is going to be the building of a full size Wacky Racer.

Watch this space for details.
