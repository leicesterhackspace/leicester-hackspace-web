We've updated our website again!

The last time we updated the site was just over a year ago in 2024, where we recreated the whole site from scratch using
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the whole website from some easy to write markdown files. This didn't change the
look of the site too much as we were just aiming to make the site easier to use.

This time, we've overhauled the whole site based on feedback from our members to make the page layout make much more
sense, to make it easier for potential new members to find relevant information, and to have much more up-to-date
photos.

You can find the website's git repo here: https://github.com/leicesterhackspace/leicester-hackspace-web, where you're
welcome to bring up issues or propose contributions.  
You can also find the full history of the website for your viewing
convenience.

We (The Web Team) look forward to bringing more improvements to all our websites!
