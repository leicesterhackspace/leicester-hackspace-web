Leicester Hackspace is a venue for makers of digital, electronic, mechanical and creative projects.

Like other Hackspaces across the country, we're working to build a community of practical and creative people and
provide them with a place to pursue their projects, share techniques and concepts and learn new skills.

Members have access to bike repair equipment, computers, 3D printers, CNC machines, power tools and many other
resources 24 hours a day. We also run special courses and events, in programming, arduino, electronics, soldering, and
more, for anyone interested in joining.
